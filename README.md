# osmos

My implementation of the good old game "osmos" using C and SDL2 library.

Original game can be found here https://www.osmos-game.com/

Mainly I was interested in creating plausible game physics and trying SDL2 library which I am new with (and having fun, of course).

I have played with some straightforward ideas and become quite happy with recieved results, which propel me to suspend all the activity on this project, however some improvements still could be done:
- coloring players based on their mass or other properties
- fast collision detection (it is O(n^2) yet, works fine on my machine for 100-500 objects)
- map scrolling
- generation of random maps or creative maps inspired by original game
- implementation clever bots or multiplayer
